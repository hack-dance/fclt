# {{name}}

## When To Use
Use this skill when the task repeatedly follows a known workflow and you want consistent, reviewable outputs.

## Inputs
- Goal and expected outcome.
- Constraints (time, tooling, compatibility).
- Required artifacts (files, commands, links).

## Steps
1. Confirm scope and assumptions in one short summary.
2. Gather only the context needed to complete the task.
3. Execute the workflow incrementally and validate after each major change.
4. Report results with concrete file/command references and remaining risks.

## Output Contract
- Include what changed and why.
- Include validation evidence (tests/checks run).
- Include clear next steps when follow-up work exists.

# {{title}}

Use this instruction when the task needs repeatable guidance that should be discoverable, targetable by writeback, and composable into agent docs.

## Scope

- Applies to:
- Does not apply to:
- Project-specific overrides:

## Guidance

- Keep the rule concrete enough that another agent can follow it without chat context.
- Link deeper reusable guidance with canonical refs such as \`@ai/instructions/VERIFICATION.md\` or \`@project/instructions/TESTING.md\`.
- Reuse stable partials with snippet markers when the same block appears in more than one rendered doc.

## Composition

<!-- fclty:global/team/example -->
<!-- /fclty:global/team/example -->

## Writeback Targeting

Record durable friction against this instruction with:

\`\`\`bash
fclt ai writeback add --kind missing_context --summary "<what was missing>" --asset instruction:{{assetName}}

Ship reliable changes quickly while keeping behavior predictable.

## Working Rules
- Prefer small, reviewable diffs.
- Preserve existing style and architecture unless a refactor is explicitly requested.
- Validate behavior with tests/checks after meaningful changes.
- Avoid destructive actions unless explicitly approved.

## Engineering Quality
- Keep implementations simple and observable.
- Fail with actionable error messages.
- Prioritize backwards compatibility and data safety.

## Delivery Format
- Summarize what changed.
- Include file and command references.
- Call out open risks and next steps.

## Code Expectations
- Write readable code with clear intent.
- Add tests for behavior changes.
- Keep command usage reproducible.

## Response Expectations
- Lead with outcome.
- Include concrete references to files and validation.
- End with the smallest useful next-step list.

Use this memory for pattern continuity:

- Primary goal: convert repeated, evidence-backed session signal into durable writeback or evolution, not chat-only summary.
- For wide reviews, partition evidence by cwd first; do not let one repo's evidence stand in for another.
- Grounding: prefer evidence from session messages, tool calls, shell commands, diffs, tests, commits, and touched files.
- Threshold: only encode signal when you can name what was learned, why it matters, and the most plausible destination.
- Scope: default to project writeback only when the repo has a project-local \`.ai\` root for capability context. If a local writable repo is missing one, bootstrap baseline project AI state with \`fclt templates init project-ai\` before retrying project-scoped writeback. Writeback/evolution review artifacts still belong under global \`~/.ai/writebacks/projects/...\` and \`~/.ai/evolution/projects/...\`, not inside the repo-local \`.ai\`. If bootstrap fails or the repo is not writable, treat that as the blocker instead of silently falling back to global runtime state.
- Promote to global only when the same signal appears across multiple repos or clearly targets shared doctrine, shared agents, or shared skills.
- Verification: distinguish one-off friction from a repeated pattern before escalating it.
- If available, use [$feedback-loop-setup]({{feedbackLoopSkill}}) when the review needs stronger feedback loops or verification framing.
- If available, use [$capability-evolution]({{capabilityEvolutionSkill}}) when repeated signal should become a concrete proposal.
- If available, delegate bounded review slices to \`learning-extractor\`, \`writeback-curator\`, \`scope-promoter\`, \`evolution-planner\`, or \`verification-auditor\` when that materially improves the review.

    prompt: `Goal: review recent Codex work in the configured CWDs and convert durable, evidence-backed signal into writebacks or reviewable evolution proposals.

- Use [LEARNING_AND_WRITEBACK.md]({{aiLearningAndWriteback}}) and [EVOLUTION.md]({{aiEvolution}}) as the durable doctrine for writeback and capability change decisions.
- Use [FEEDBACK_LOOPS.md]({{aiFeedbackLoops}}) and [VERIFICATION.md]({{aiVerification}}) when you need stronger loop design or more defensible proof.
- If available, use [$feedback-loop-setup]({{feedbackLoopSkill}}) when you need stronger feedback loops, success criteria, or verification framing.
- If available, use [$capability-evolution]({{capabilityEvolutionSkill}}) when repeated signal appears strong enough to become a durable capability proposal.
- If it will materially improve quality, explicitly ask Codex to spawn narrow subagents such as \`learning-extractor\`, \`writeback-curator\`, \`scope-promoter\`, \`evolution-planner\`, or \`verification-auditor\`. Only use them for bounded, non-overlapping review slices.

Grounding rules:
- Work only from evidence in Codex sessions and nearby repo artifacts for the configured CWDs.
- Partition the review by cwd first. Name which configured cwds had real evidence this run and which did not.
- Prefer evidence from session messages, tool calls, shell commands, diffs, tests, commits, and touched files.
- Do not speculate about intent or propose changes that are not anchored in evidence.
- Distinguish one-off friction from repeated signal. Escalate only when the signal is durable enough to matter.

Decision rules:
- Use \`fclt ai writeback add\` when the signal, target asset, and scope are clear.
- Before attempting project-scoped writeback, verify the cwd has a repo-local \`.ai\` root for capability context. If it does not and the cwd is a local writable repo, run \`fclt templates init project-ai\` from that repo root, then continue. Do not write writeback/evolution review artifacts into the repo-local \`.ai\`; fclt mirrors them under global \`~/.ai/writebacks/projects/...\` and \`~/.ai/evolution/projects/...\` with cwd/project metadata. If bootstrap fails or the repo is not writable, report the writeback as blocked by missing project AI state rather than falling back to merged/global runtime state.
- Before passing \`--asset\`, verify the target resolves in the Facult graph. If the destination is a raw file path or otherwise not graph-backed, report that as a missing-asset blocker instead of retrying blind.
- Use \`fclt ai evolve\` only when repeated signal is strong enough to justify a reviewable capability change.
- Prefer project scope unless the learning clearly belongs in shared global doctrine, shared agents, shared skills, or other cross-project capability.
- For wide automations, require repeated evidence across more than one cwd before recommending a global/shared capability change unless the target is obviously global.
- Skip weak, speculative, or purely anecdotal observations.

Verification:
- Verify every claim against at least one concrete artifact.
- Call out residual uncertainty instead of overstating confidence.
- Separate missing context, weak verification, failed execution, and reusable pattern; do not collapse them together.

Output:
- Coverage: which cwds had concrete evidence, and which were effectively idle for this run.
- Recorded writebacks: what you recorded, why, and the target asset or command used.
- Evolution candidates: only the strongest repeated signals, with rationale and likely scope.
- Watch list: promising signals not yet strong enough to encode.
- Gaps in current operating model or verification harness: only if evidence supports them.

Keep the result concise, high-signal, and operational. If nothing crosses the threshold, say what you reviewed and why no writeback or evolution was justified.`,
